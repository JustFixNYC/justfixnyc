<h4 class="no-margin-top">Our Mission</h4>

<img class="img-responsive col-sm-6 pull-right" src="http://degy28l8twq8c.cloudfront.net/tenantphone.jpg" />


<p>JustFix.nyc works to support tenants in neglectful housing situations with technology that helps them build well-documented legal cases and connect with community advocates.
<b>Our goal is healthy and safe homes for all.</b></p>



<h4>The Problem</h4>


<p>This is a critical moment for New York and housing - the city is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented development combined with heightened inequality. These changes have brought new levels of harassment and neglect from landlords seeking to displace longstanding communities from their neighborhoods. As a result, tenants in these communities are left to rent apartments in a state of shocking disrepair: without adequate heating, exposed to wind and weather, infested with mold and vermin.</p>

<img class="img-responsive col-sm-6 pull-left" src="http://degy28l8twq8c.cloudfront.net/family.jpg" />


<p>Substandard housing quality exists in NYC at a breathtaking scale. According to the most recent Comptroller’s report, around 1.2 million New Yorkers live in “deficient” housing. This means that at any given time, their homes have 3 or more open code violations present and unaddressed.  A healthy home is fundamental to individual as well as community health, and these issues have severely disproportionate implications for minority and immigrant families living in low-income neighborhoods. According to a report published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 40% of diagnosed asthma cases - which affects 20 million Americans annually and is the most common chronic disease among children - are believed to be attributable to exposures from inadequate residential housing.</p>

<p>Currently, the resources available for tenants to address these issues - such as filing complaints with the city and seeking pro bono legal services - tend to be capacity constrained, hard to navigate, and difficult to understand. All told, around 90% of tenants who go to Housing Court do so unrepresented and the vast majority are backed into exploitative situations because they don’t know their rights or are unable to easily provide the evidence they need for a strong case. Community organizers spend too much of their precious time and resources handling logistics and paperwork related to referrals and case management, instead of advocating for new policies and providing on-the-ground support.</p>

<p>As the city of New York allocates millions of dollars to increase advice and counseling for tenants in these situations, non-profit legal service organizations are facing the need to scale at an unprecedented rate. <b>This is where we believe JustFix.nyc can make a meaningful impact.</b> Using data and technology, we can equip tenants with easy-to-use tools to document their issues and stretch resources further within the pre-existing ecosystem of organizations, in turn serving many more individuals and families in need.</p>





<h4>OUR APPROACH</h4>

<p>Our research has involved countless hours spent observing Housing Court procedures, working on the front-lines with community advocates and building residents, consulting with government officials, and assisting in the formation of tenant associations. Through our experience, we have witnessed first-hand the lengths that someone will go to combat inadequate living conditions for their family.</p>

<img class="img-responsive col-sm-6 pull-left" src="http://degy28l8twq8c.cloudfront.net/rockaway.jpg" />

<p>The core focus of our work is centered around the existing eco-system, outlining the points at which technology can facilitate crucial work already being done. We are here to <b>augment, not replace</b> these invaluable in-person resources - such as local organizing efforts and pro bono legal services - by streamlining how they track cases, communicate with tenants, and handle referrals. We are also invested in integrating municipal services, such as 311 complaints and housing inspections, as a way to provide more context-rich data and analytics to the city agencies responsible for addressing these issues.</p>


<h4>OUR SOLUTION</h4>
<p>JustFix.nyc is focused on how technology can equip tenants and tenant rights organizations to solve housing issues at scale. Using unprecedented access to data published by city and state agencies, we are able to provide more personalized services, target users in key neighborhoods, and identify particular building or landlord cases in a way that has never been done before.</p>

<p>Our initial product is a mobile app designed to assist tenants in documenting and building their case - the first key step when individuals and families are facing housing issues. It will also allow tenant organizations to increase the number of tenants served by improving the efficacy of their low-touch services. It is centered around the following features:</p>

<p>
<b>Tenant App</b>
<ul>
	<li>A single place for tenants to upload evidence, track efforts, and document their maintenance issues and living conditions.</li>
	<li>A personalized guide outlining the most effective methods of action in resolving these issues, with a focus on making meaningful referrals to local resources and automating complex bureaucratic tasks.</li>
	<li>A format to easily view the timeline of actions that the tenant has completed and share it with advocates, lawyers, and judges as part of the resolution process.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br />


<p>
In addition to the tenant mobile app, which helps tenants work more effectively with advocates and legal services, we are also focused on a product that streamlines case management for the tenant organizer. Our current phase of research and design is focused on building a platform that meets their needs and facilitates the intake process as well as outreach efforts. The organizer dashboard will be centered around the following objectives:
</p>

<p>
<b>Advocate Dashboard</b>
<ul>
	<li>Automating low touch interventions in order to allow for more high touch in-person interventions.</li>
	<li>Aggregating individual and group cases in order to manage and review actions, evidence, and progress of their clients as well as highlighting potential unaddressed buildings or individuals in their service area.</li>
	<li>A place to streamline communication between an organizer or attorney and a group of tenants, keeping resident informed in the legal process and facilitating collective decision-making.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Milestones</h4>

<!-- <img class="img-responsive col-sm-6 pull-right" src="http://degy28l8twq8c.cloudfront.net/nytm.jpg" /> -->

<p>We are currently conducting distributed pilot programs testing both our user experience as well as our integration with pre-existing city services such as 311, HPD inspectors, and the NYS Court’s Access to Justice program. All testing and outreach is done through close coordination with community and nonprofit partners. We are currently working in several areas. Our main pilot is in partnership with <a href="http://casapower.org" target="_blank">Community Action for Safe Apartments (CASA)</a>, a membership driven tenant organizing group that works primarily in the Southwest Bronx. We plan to distribute our platform to several hundred residents as well as work closely with CASA to further develop our custom tools for organizing and creating tenant associations. We have also established three testing locations at community justice centers in Brownsville, Crown Heights, and Harlem in conjunction with our partners at the <a href="http://www.courtinnovation.org/" target="_blank">Center for Court Innovation</a> with plans to expand to greater distribution in other neighborhoods that are experiencing high-levels of displacement and exploitation.</p>

<p>Through the <a href="http://labs.robinhood.org" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Labs fellowship</a>, we began to conduct more in-depth user research (including interviews, focus groups, and case management) and sought expert advice (housing court judges, legal experts, and tenant organizers) to further validate our approach and discover problems that could be addressed in part by technology. The fellowship is a 12-week program for teams to build digital products aimed at addressing key issues faced by low-income New Yorkers, with an approach focused on human-centered design, testing, and outreach work.</p>

<p><b>We are currently seeking partnerships and further collaboration with any groups dedicated to tenant’s rights in New York City, and are hoping to establish initial pilot programs in 2016-2017 to continue building, testing, and refining JustFix.nyc. Please <a href="mailto:hello@justfix.nyc?subject=Tell me more about JustFix.nyc!" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you are interested in discussing further or would like a demonstration.</b></p>
