  <h1>How It Works</h1>

  <p>
    The JustFix.nyc Advocate Dashboard helps you stay connected with the tenants you are working with and assist them on their housing issues. It can help you keeps information organized and streamline the process of building a strong case. With this dashboard you can:
    <ul>
      <li>View cases of JustFix.nyc users who have shared their account with you</li>
      <li>Create and manage cases on behalf of tenants who are unable to create accounts for themselves</li>
      <li>View cases individually or grouped by address</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>USING YOUR ADVOCATE CODE</h2>
  <p>
    The Advocate Code you created is unique to you. Share your Advocate Code with tenants so they can connect with you through the Tenant App.
    <ol>
      <li>When you refer a tenant to JustFix.nyc, give them your Advocate Code.</li>
      <li>They will enter your code when signing up at <b>www.justfix.nyc</b>.</li>
      <li>Your contact information is shared with them, so they can reach out to you if necessary.</li>
      <li>If you change your contact email address or phone number, that will automatically be passed to the tenant as well!</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    Your Advocate Code is <b>{{ user.code }}</b>!

  <h2>DIFFERENT TYPES OF TENANT ACCOUNTS</h2>
  <p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <b>Linked Accounts</b>
        <p>A linked account is one that the tenant manages on their own after using your Advocate Code. You can see a "shared" view of their case if they have enabled sharing, otherwise you will only see some basic information about them.</p>
        <!-- <button class="btn btn-info">Manage</button> -->
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <b>Managed Accounts</b>
        <p>A managed account is one you create and maintain on behalf of a tenant. Adding a managed account helps you track information for a tenant who will not be using JustFix.nyc directly.</p>

    <i><b>Tip:</b> Creating a managed tenant account is easy to do during a home visit - you can conduct the room-by-room inspection, gather photo evidence, and have it all organized for later!</i>

  <h1>Best Practices</h1>

  <h2>USING JUSTFIX.NYC IN YOUR EVERYDAY WORK</h2>
  <p>
    The features of this dashboard have been the result of many months of research and testing. We have been using it internally to work with hundreds of tenants across NYC, and have found some best practices:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Schedule follow ups and check ins based on how you work. Suggest specific things for your tenants to be doing through the app (see example actions)</li>
      <li>
        Encourage tenants to use JustFix.nyc like a daily diary by posting State Updates through the Tenant App. The more you document, the stronger your case will be!
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure to track outcomes or resolutions as well!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <i><b>Tip:</b> The more you check in on your tenants and their JustFix.nyc cases, the more they will document!</i>
  </p>

  <h2>ACTIONS THAT TENANTS CAN TAKE ON JUSTFIX.NYC</h2>
