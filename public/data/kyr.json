		"excerpt": "Rent stabilization is a set of laws that determine the amount of rent a tenant may be charged, the services that must provided, and registration requirements that the landlord must fulfill.",

		"content": "<p>The main benefits of rent-stabilization for tenants are:<ul><li>The right to renew your lease and be protected against arbitrary evictions (you can only be evicted on a limited number of grounds.)</li><li>Protection from steep and unexpected rent increases.</li><li>The right to good services and repairs, with recourse if they are not provided</li><li>The right to pass on your apartment to certain family members who live with you for a period of time prior to you moving out or dying</li></ul></p><h4>Am I rent stabilized?</h4><p>As a general rule, apartments in buildings with six or more residential rental units that were built prior to January 1, 1974 are subject to the Rent Stabilization Law and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act. However, many units that appear to be covered are sometimes not. </p><p>If you are unsure about your lease type, you can request your rental history from the New York State Division of Housing &#38; Community Renewal (DHCR). Email through JustFix.nyc or visit <a href=http://www.nyshcr.org/forms/rent/ra84.pdf>DHCR’s website</a>.</p><div collapse=!expand><h4>Protections</h4><p>With some limited exceptions, if you are a rent stabilized tenant, you are entitled to renew your lease for one or two years (the choice is yours) on the same terms and conditions as your original lease - except for lawful increases in the rent. </p><p>The maximum amount that the rent for your apartment can increase when you renew your lease is set each year by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, with somewhat higher increases for a two year renewals than for one-year renewals. </p><p>Your landlord is required to offer a lease renewal between 90 and 150 days before your lease expires, and you have 60 days to respond. If your landlord does not offer you a renewal lease, this does not put you at risk of eviction. Whether or not your landlord offers you a renewal lease, your rights as a rent-stabilized tenant remain the same. The old lease and rent amount remain in effect until a renewal lease is offered and takes effect.</p></div><div collapse=!expand><h4>What if I'm not rent-stablilized?</h4><p>If you live in a “market rate apartment”, there’s unfortunately not much you can do to prevent your landlord from raising your rent. You can try to negotiate with them. </p><p>You should not be afraid to stand up to an abusive or negligent landlord. Contact 311 to file any housing related complaints anonymously. </p><p>Be sure to check out the Find Help page on this site to search for resources available to you.</p></div>",

		"content": "<p>If you landlord continues to ignore your requests for repairs, you may want to consider taking them to court to force them to make repairs. This page will help you understand how to sue your landlord for repairs.</p><h4>Filing an HP Action</h4><p> <strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>To bring a HP Action, you will need to go to the housing court in your borough. Go to the clerk’s office and ask for the the papers for an HP Action. The clerk will then give you two forms: <br/>“Order to Show Cause”<br/>“Verified Petition in Support of An Order to Show Cause.”<br/>And if you are low-income, also ask the clerk for the “Poor Person Relief” form in order to avoid paying the &#36;40 filing fee for the HP Action.<blockquote>TIP! Make sure you know the name of your landlord! <a href=https://hpdonline.hpdnyc.org/HPDonline/select_application.aspx>Click here</a> to find the full name of your landlord and the correct address to mail them the court papers.</blockquote></p><div collapse=!expand><p> <strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Once you provide the clerk the finished forms, the clerk will notarize the papers. She or he will also give you a inspection date for HPD to visit your apartment. Make sure you have some dates that you are free.<br><br/><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Next, a judge will review and sign your forms.</p><p>Finally, your papers will go back to the clerk in order to assign the hearing date. You will have to mail the court forms to your landlord by a certain date as well. The Court has a very specific way it wants you to mail these forms. Please follow carefully or you might risk having the case thrown out.<br/><br/>While you wait for your court date, make sure you collect important evidence that will be helpful to present to the housing judge.</p></div>",

		"content": "<h4>What is a non payment case?</h4> <p>The landlord is asking the court to order you to pay rent or to evict you if you cannot pay rent. You have the right to dispute this claim in court and present evidence. A nonpayment case in Housing Court does not necessarily mean that you must leave the apartment. If you have the money for the rent, the landlord must accept it.</p><h4>How does a landlord start a non payment case?</h4> <p>A landlord must first demand the rent from you either orally or in writing. After demanding the rent, the landlord can file papers in court to start a nonpayment case. These papers are called a “notice of petition” and “petition.” After the papers are filed in court, they will be served on you and the court will mail a postcard letting you know that a case was filed. Once you have received the petition, you have five days to go to the court and file your “answer.” You can tell the court your defenses and you will be given a date to come back to court for a hearing.</p><h4>What is a holdover case?</h4> <p>This is a court action in which your landlord is demanding possession of the apartment and wants to evict you. If you live in a private house, co-op or condo apartment and you do not have a lease the landlord does not have to have a reason for wanting you out of the apartment. If you live in a rent regulated apartment (rent control or rent stabilized) or subsidized, OR if you have a lease, the landlord must have a good reason for wanting you out in order to succeed in a holdover case. A holdover proceeding can be brought against a tenant even if the tenant has paid the rent.</p>",

		"title": "Creating a tenant association",
		"excerpt": "A tenants' association is a group of tenants who live in the same building or development who choose to join forces in advocating for themselves, particularly in dealings with the landlord or management. Tenant associations commonly form to address problems - such as a landlord who fails to provide timely repairs or adequate services, or who is trying to evict tenants or pressure them to move.",
		"content": "<h4>Why form a tenant association?</h4> <p>A tenant association is a union of all or most of the tenants in a building. When tenants work together, they can apply more pressure to make a landlord provide services, make repairs, and stop harassment. A strong tenant association can force a landlord to listen; as a group, the tenants can have more leverage to negotiate, file complaints with the city and state agencies that oversee housing, get help from elected officials, or go to court.</p><h4>Starting a tenant association?</h4> <p>If you think that your building really needs a tenant association, it's probably because you have problems that you can't get corrected by yourself no matter how hard you try.</p><p>It is almost certain that other tenants in the building feel the same way—and some of them will be more than willing to start working together with you. The first step in forming a tenant association is to find out who those tenants are, and the best way to do that is to call a meeting and see who comes. Housing law guarantees your right to meet in a public space in your building, so feel free to use the lobby or any other public space for your meetings.</p><div collapse=!expand><p><strong>You can advertise the meeting by putting notes under people's doors, posting flyers in the hallways, and talking directly to the people you already know.</strong></p><p>It's a good idea to try to arrive at some kind of agreement among the tenants about who will represent the association while it's starting out, and decide on one or more people to be your contacts. These could be the people who called the meeting and/or other building residents who have the respect of the tenants. You can also ask people to volunteer to be 'floor captains,' so that work and responsibilities can be shared. The floor captains can distribute meeting notices, coordinate building surveys, and act as contacts for the tenants on their floors.</p></div><div collapse=!expand><h4>Getting your building involved</h4> <p>1. Door Knocking<br/>Going from door to door and talking to your fellow tenants directly—and listening to what they have to say—helps create a sense of connection around your shared problems, and build support for the association. This is also a perfect opportunity to conduct a building survey—to make a record of all the problems in the individual apartments and public areas of the building. <br/><br/>2. Using Notes, Flyers, and Newsletters<br/>A note under the door is the easiest way to reach everyone in the building, especially if you want to alert people to an event—like an upcoming tenant association meeting. Keep your notes short, sweet, and to the point. You can also post flyers around the building announcing tenant association activities. Include the names and home phone numbers of the representatives of the association.<br/><br/>3.
